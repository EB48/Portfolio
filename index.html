      <p>
         Hi! My name is Eden Berhanu. I graduated with a bachelors in software engineering at Western Governors university where I gained a strong foundation in software development. I have an interest in building reliable, well-structured applications. I’ve worked across both front-end and back-end technologies, including Java/Spring, JavaScript/TypeScript, Angular, and SQL, and I enjoy understanding how different parts of a system work together. 
         <br><br>
         Through hands-on projects and industry certifications, I’ve gained experience with modern development tools, cloud fundamentals, and collaborative workflows. I value clear communication, attention to detail, and writing code that is maintainable and easy to understand.
         <br><br>
         I’m currently seeking an entry-level software developer role where I can continue developing my skills, contribute to team goals, and grow as a software professional.

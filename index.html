      Hi! My name is Eden Berhanu. I am a student currently attending Western Governors University (WGU) working towards a Bachelors degree in Software Engineering. I have taken Web development courses and obtained skills in HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I received a Front-end developer certificate from WGU which showcases my proficiency in creating responsive and fully functional websites. I have also received experience in TypeScript, Angular, and Python. I will soon be learning back-end frameworks and Java. I am looking forward to learning more software applications and skills. In my free time  I enjoy spending time with family, going to parks, hiking and being surrounded by nature.
